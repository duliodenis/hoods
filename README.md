# Hoods

*NYC and San Francisco*


## The Goal

The solution for finding specific content in an area


## The App

Map with facebook friends to share location-based content


# Phase One - Gather Media

Posting of location-based pics, gifs, and videos to the map with tags.

Ephemeral content from facebook friends appears by default on map.

*(TBD)* Posting of live videos, found animals, and more location-based content to map.

*(Phase Two)* Posting of POI reviews to map.


# Phase Two - Enable Search and Ads

POIs become available and can be reviewed.

Long queries with multiple parameters to get specific results:

**"pizza"**(tag) in **"Lower East Side"**(hood) *POIs that sell pizza*

**"lightbulbs"**(tag) *POIs that sell lightbulbs near current location*

**"pics"**(media) of **"pizza"**(tag) at **"Dominos"**(POI) in **"St. George, Staten Island"**(hood)

**"gifs"**(media) of **"butts"**(tag) in **"Times Square"**(hood)

**"live video"**(media) in **"SoHo"**(hood)

**"reviews"**(media) of **"lobster"**(tag)

## Opportunities for ads:
